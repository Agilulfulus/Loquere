            <h1>Let's Talk About Bubble Sort</h1>
            <h2>11/6/2017</h2>
            <p>
                Sorting algorithms have a special place in my heart, they're
                just so damn nifty and fun to do. The first I learned, and
                probably the first you'd learn in a compsci class, was bubble
                sort. It's a terrible algorithm when it comes to speed and power,
                but it's simple enough that you can understand it in about 5
                minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic idea is this: you have a list of <i>n</i> items, and
                for each item as you iterate along the list, you compare it to
                the previous. If it's less than the previous, you swap the two,
                while if it's larger (or equal, I suppose), you leave it be.
                This is done repeatedly until a cycle runs with no swaps. In the
                worst case scenario, the algorithm will loop once for each item,
                and in the best case it'll loop once (i.e., you sent it a list
                that's already solved <s>you dumb shit</s>).
            </p>
            <p>
                A more programmatic way to look at it, there are two loops, each
                one going over each element, so O(O(n)) or O(n^2). I have no clue
                if O(O(n)) is actually a thing but it makes sense to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that worthwhile explanation, how about we have some source
                code! I'll just start out with some basic pseudocode:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
sort(array) {
    for n in array do {
        for i from 1 length of array do {
            if array[i] &lt; array[i - 1] then swap
        }
    }
    return array
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Simple, right? Pretty clear to see why it's inneffecient; it has
                to loop over everything repeatedly. If you're a professional don't
                do a bubble sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>I'm going to do a little experiment about it's inneffeciency with
                the following C++ code:</s> as it turns out compilers are <i>really</i>
                smart and it can tell that I'm trying to write something inneffecient
                and automatically converts it to another algorithm, don't know which.
                That's both really cool and really annoying. I don't know how to
                disable these optimizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>To be continued when I figure that out...</i>

            <p>
                On this day 10 minutes ago, I started a blog that I hope to dedicate to programming. 
                I'm going to be honest, I like to code. I think it's some really fun stuff to do. I
                don't really understand it all, but I try. Perhaps through this blog I'll gain a further
                understanding of the art, and improve all the projects I forget I've dedicated myself to.
            </p>
            <p>
                First things first, I know a bit of C++. I consider that by and far my favorite language
                to program in, and I'll probably post a bunch using it. My understanding is that C++ is
                not accepted by certain individuals who call it "too bulky," "unnecessary", and "ugly"
                - amongst other things. Now that's just real damn rude, don't you think? It's a perfectly
                valid language. It's got all the cool things these days, like lambdas and garbage collection
                (shared pointers) and dynamic allocation and whatever else the current hipster language
                is doing. And besides - what kind of argument is "ugly"? It's a programming language. If
                you're in the discipline for the aesthetic value you're doing it wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also know Java, learned it before C++. I mess around in Lua on occasion. Overall not too
                shabby for a beginner. Doesn't mean I'm an expert in any, but you find far too many blogs
                with people who are god damn experts in their language and you're like "well wtf I don't
                understand half these things" and I think having a blog by someone who <i>almost</i> knows
                what they're doing is a big help.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's my philosophy and I'm sticking to it. I'll try and post once a day.
