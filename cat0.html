					<p>
						The verb 'esse' is the Latin equivalent of the English 'to be,' otherwise known as the copula. In English there
						are minor conjugations, as in 'I am' vs 'you are,' but for Latin each pronoun has a seperate conjugation. Latin
						is a <i>highly inflected</i> language, so almost every word will have multiple forms.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Sentence structure in Latin is very loose compared to English. English has a strict subject-verb-object
						pattern, deviating from that structure would seem incorrect. Compare 'he is a man' with 'he a man is.' The former
						is undoubtedly the correct form. Latin does not have this restriction, so while the most common pattern is
						subject-object-verb, the word order can be manipulated as per the author's disgression (which makes reading good
						Latin authors an ardeous ordeal).
					</p>
					<p>
						When we get to learning declensions, the reason for this loose structure will make more sense.
