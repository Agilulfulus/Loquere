						The verb 'esse' is the Latin equivalent of the English 'to be,' otherwise known as the copula. In English there
						are minor conjugations, as in 'I am' vs 'you are,' but for Latin each pronoun has a seperate conjugation. Latin
						is a <i>highly inflected</i> language, so almost every word will have multiple forms.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Sentence structure in Latin is very loose compared to English. English has a strict subject-verb-object
						pattern, deviating from that structure would seem incorrect. Compare 'he is a man' with 'he a man is.' The former
						is undoubtedly the correct form. Latin does not have this restriction, so while the most common pattern is
						subject-object-verb, the word order can be manipulated as per the author's disgression (which makes reading good
						Latin authors an ardeous ordeal).
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The difference between <b>suus</b> and <b>eius</b> is not something that exists explicitly in the English language.
						In Latin, there is something called a reflexive pronoun, which refers directly to the subject. This is what the
						possessive 'suus' does. For instance, <i>is cattum suum amat</i> 'he loves his cat': in this sentence, the subject is 'is',
						or 'he', and therefore 'suum' translates as 'his,' and refers to the 'he' we put as the subject. <i>Is cattum eius amat</i>,
						on the other hand, can be translated verbatim, but the 'eius' [his] <i>cannot</i> refer to the 'he' subject of the sentence.
						The 'eius' refers to a seperate 'he.' Therefore it may be wise to translate thus: 'he loves some-other-male-individual's cat.'

					<p>
						The accusative declension is used for most verbs, and functions as a declaration for the noun to be the sentence's object. 
						If that doesn't make sense - bare with me. <i>Vir femina amat</i> - this sentence is grammatically incorrect, both 'vir' and 
						'femina' are in the <b>nominative</b> case, meaning that they are the subject of the sentence. Unfortunately, you can't have 
						two random unrelated subjects, so the sentence is meaningless (some may suggest that a translation <i>could</i> be 'the man, the woman loves').
						To make it correct, either 'vir' or 'femina' has to be in the accusative. If we want to say that the man loves the woman, then
						'femina' becomes accusative (femina<b>m</b>) because she is the object of the sentence <s>don't objectify women</s>. If we want to
						say that the woman loves the man, then 'vir' becomes accusative (vir<b>um</b>) likewise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Declining nouns is not always the same, even above 'femina' and 'vir' both decline differently. While the rules will have to be
						fully detailed later on, it is worth noting that <i>most</i> nouns ending in -a (femina<b>m</b>, aqua<b>m</b>, puella<b>m</b>) add an -m in the accusative,
						and masculine nouns ending in -r or -us add an -um (for the -us ending, the -us is replaced with the -um: 'domin<b>us</b>' -> 'domin<b>um</b>').
					</p>
					<p>
						There are 6 declensions (with the exception of maybe a handful of nouns) to learn, each with its own nuances. For the time being,
						learn to understand the differences between the nominative and accusative.
