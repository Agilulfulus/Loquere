						Just a short section to get you acquainted with Roman social life!
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Truthfully, we don't <i>exactly</i> know how the average speaker of Classical Latin
						would've greeted someone, but we can extrapolate based on the inscriptions from citizens
						and how these phrases descended into the modern Romance languages.
					</p>
					<p>
						Something to note - there is a differentiation between singular and plural greetings/phrases.
						Words like 'salve' and 'vale' are not functionally equivalent to their English counterparts, rather
						they are commands. 'Salvere' is the verb <i>to be healthy</i> and 'valere' is the verb <i>to be strong</i>.
						Therefore, when you're saying 'hello' to someone, you're actually telling them 'be healthy!' and when you
						respond 'I am well,' you're literally replying 'I am strong!' In addition, saying 'goodbye' is the command
						form of 'valere' - the same word to say that you are 'well,' so saying 'bye' is actually saying 'be strong!'
					</p>
					<p>
						This is why there's a differentiation between singular and plural. In Latin, commands (the imperative mood)
						are conjugated based on plurality. Conjugation for this mood is simple for most verbs; you remove the -re
						ending for the singular, and for the plural you tack on a -te: <b>ama, amate</b>, <b>bibi, bibite</b>, <b>ede, edete</b>.
