						Location, prepositions, conjunctions, and more declensions.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Latin prepositions are, in the grand scheme of things, fairly similar to their English counterparts.
						<i>In</i> can be translated to 'in,' <i>ad</i> can be translated to 'at', and the remainder that aren't
						directly compatable have descended into the world of English prefixes: <i>cum</i> -> 'con-,' <i>ab</i> -> 'ab-.'
						What is particular, however, is the manner in which these consonants are used syntactically.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the most part, there are two declensions used the consonants - the accusative and the ablative. After the 
						first lesson in this module you should realize that <i>in</i> and <i>ab</i> reference the ablative while <i>ad</i>
						references the accusative. This is not an arbitrary distinction; there is a genuine reason as to why the ablative
						is used for some and the accusative for others.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ablative is characterized by seperation and location. So words that translate to 'from' or 'out of' (like <i>ab</i>)
						will use the ablative, same with words that dictate current location, like <i>in</i>. The accusative is characterized by 'goal of motion'
						- as in - where you aren't right now, but where you will be / want to be. Words like <i>ad</i> express this because
						while they may appear to dictate 'location,' 'to' as a preposition always requires a proceeding location.
					</p>
					<p>
						While there are many, many other uses for ablative, the above is the main distinction. For now, just remember that <i>in</i>
						and <i>ab</i> require ablative, and <i>ad</i> requires the accusative.
